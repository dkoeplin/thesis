\chapter{The Spatial Compiler}
\label{compiler}

Since Spatial is designed to capture algorithms that are intended to run on reconfigurable architectures,
which gives rise to analyses and optimizations that are not used in software compilers.
In this chapter, we describe the compiler's intermediate representation and its key passes, as summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:compilerflow}.

When targeting FPGAs, the Spatial compiler provides source-to-source translations from applications in the Spatial abstraction to synthesizable hardware descriptions in Chisel RTL~\cite{chisel}.
Host (CPU) code is generated in C++.
While
details of targeting Plasticine are discussed in prior work~\cite{plasticine}.
