\chapter{The High Level Compiler}
\label{delite}

We begin our description of the process for compiling DSLs to FPGAs with
the high level compiler. The system diagram for this high level compiler is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:delite-diag}.
As shown in this figure, the purpose of the high level compiler is to take
programs represented in the parallel patterns described in
Chapter~\ref{parallel-patterns} and lower them to a form which can be more easily
translated to hardware. For the purposes of this chapter, we will assume the
target DSL already has a lowering path to parallel patterns. While the
transformations described in this chapter are generally applicable to any
target hardware, we will discuss them with particular focus on their implications
when targeting FPGAs.

One of the key challenges of generating efficient custom architectures from
high level languages is in coping with arbitrarily large data structures.
Since main memory accesses are expensive and resources on the FPGA are limited,
our goal is to store a reasonably sized working set in the FPGA's local memory
for as long as possible. Ideally, we also want to hide memory transfer latencies
by overlapping communication with computation using prefetching hardware.

To this end, in this chapter we describe a method for automatically tiling parallel
patterns to improve program locality and data reuse.
Like classic loop tiling, our pattern tiling method is composed of two
transformations: strip mining and interchange.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:delite-diag}, the high level compiler is also responsible
for performing various well known, target-agnostic transformations like loop fusion,
loop invariant code motion, and common subexpression elimination (CSE).
We refer the reader to prior work~\cite{rompf12optimizing,brown16clusters} for
detailed descriptions of these other transformations.

This compiler is responsible for performing various target-agnostic optimizations
on the input program, including loop fusion, loop invariant code motion, common
subexpression elimination (CSE),
and parallel pattern tiling. It also performs basic pipeline schedule analysis
and annotates this information for the lower level compiler.}
