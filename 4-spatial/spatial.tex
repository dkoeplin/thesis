\chapter{The Spatial Hardware Abstraction}
\label{spatial}

The next step in our framework is to lower the tiled parallel pattern
representation into a form which can be more easily optimized for
performance on FPGAs. In this chapter, we discuss the requirements for
an abstraction for targeting FPGAs and describe some of the limitations with
existing abstractions. We then provide an overview of Spatial, our new
hardware abstraction for targeting reconfigurable hardware, and detail how
this abstraction meets our defined criteria.
