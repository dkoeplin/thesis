\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we discussed our requirements for a hardware abstraction when
compiling from high level DSLs. We discussed existing high level synthesis tools
in light of their requirements, and discussed the need for a new abstraction.
We then presented Spatial, a new domain-specific abstraction and language
for the design of application accelerators on reconfigurable architectures.
Spatial includes hardware-specific abstractions for control, memory,
and design tuning which help to provide a balance
between productive and performance-driven accelerator design.
In the next chapter, we will look at how the Spatial compiler uses these
abstractions in order to optimize hardware designs and generate efficient accelerators.
