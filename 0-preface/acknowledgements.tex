Like so many systems projects, the work in this thesis would not have been
possible without the help of
a great number of people. First and foremost, my advisor Kunle Olukotun.
Kunle's role in my PhD career and in this project can perhaps be summarized by
our first interaction together in my first week at Stanford.
After I described my research interests in
machine learning and reconfigurable computing, Kunle suggested that I review recent
work in the area to see if we might think of a way to do something better.
``Or different,'' I suggested, to which he quickly responded ``let's stick
with better.''  Ever since then, Kunle been the guiding force helping me and this
project move forward and stay out of the weeds.

Key components of this work were the result of long discussions and even longer
working hours by various members of the Pervasive Parallelism Lab.
Every part of this thesis was joint work with Raghu Prabhakar, who joined PPL
at the same time that I did. In addition to his own thesis work on the Plasticine
architecture, Raghu was instrumental in the compiler's
first code generator, got me addicted to coffee,
and repeatedly made me cringe at his terrible jokes.
I'd also like to thank Matt Feldman, who we forced to become an expert in Chisel
because both Raghu and I got tired of writing RTL,
and who tried but ultimately failed to teach me how to juggle.
For all my work in the compiler's guts, Raghu and Matt have been largely
responsible for Spatial's code generator backends, without which the
compiler really wouldn't be much of a compiler at all.
It was also great working with Yaqi Zhang, Tian Zhao, Stefan Hadjis, Matt Vilim,
and Chris Aberger over the years.

I received a lot of excellent early insights into this project from my senior
colleagues in the PPL group, including Arvind Sujeeth, Kevin Brown, HyoukJoong
Lee, Chris De Sa, and Kevin Conley. Chief among these insights was the use of
Scala and parallel patterns, both of which I have since grown to (mostly) love.

I have also had extremely helpful discussions on the design of Spatial
with a multitude of other people, including (but certainly not limited to)
Professor Christos Kozyrakis, Professor Kayvon Fatahalian, Professor Mark Horowitz,
Luigi Nardi, Ardavan Pedram, Ruben Fiszel, Nathan Zhang, Alex Rucker, and
numerous other members of the DAWN research group too numerous to list.


Lastly, I should thank all of my coworkers at SambaNova Systems. Our time
together so far has been wonderful and I am greatly looking forward to what
the future will have to offer us (and, of course, vice versa).
